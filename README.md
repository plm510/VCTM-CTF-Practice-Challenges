# VCTM CTF Practice Challenges
A repository to host VCTM CTF practice challenges

Challenge-1 (Crypto)
---------------------
challenge files: flag.bin, public.pem

Challenge: We generated the public and private keys, and encrypted the flag but private key got deleted accidently. Now your task is to decrypt the flag.bin and send us the flag over mail.

Hint-1: “E N D” is very important.
